summary: 'the thoughts that have been quietly piling up.'

I was scrolling through social media the other day,

Tapping through stories, just passing time—

When one story made me pause:

> Remembering the friends who helped me and <mark>remembering the ones who didn't when times were tough</mark>

It stuck with me.

It reminded me of a time, not too long ago, when some old school friends asked to borrow money—each with their own unique reasons. I didn't lend it to them. Could they be holding a grudge because of that?

A few thoughts started spinning in my head:
- Why me? Why ask *me* for money?
- Some of them already had jobs—while I was still in college, barely getting by.
- Could I have flipped it and asked them, just because *they* had a paycheck?

<mark>When someone feels they can help, they usually will.-</mark>

But if they _can't_—
Should we really push them to?
To make them struggle too, just for the sake of "helping"?
Feels off, doesn't it?

There's a line from Tierson (jot) I really like.
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
size='large'
className='hover:scale-102 transition-transform'

</div>

It lingers in my mind.

At the end of the day,
I don't get how someone could be mad
just because you didn't lend them money.

Just thought I'd share the thoughts that have been quietly piling up.
