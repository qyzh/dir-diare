I think moving on from someone you thought would stay is hard because we never imagine any moment without them.

Maybe it's because with her you felt you were at peace, and even after she left, your heart was always clinging to the last bit of hope that she would look back and see that you still love and still ^^cherish^^ her.

You were still willing to put everything aside just to see her beside you. It's so hard to realize that the person you thought would never hurt you suddenly became the very person to break your heart. ==I guess the worst part about letting go of her memories is realizing that she no longer belongs here, and you can't even tell her how much it hurts.==
