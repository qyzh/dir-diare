# Building a Dota 2 Dashboard: A Journey into Game Analytics

As a passionate Dota 2 player and developer, I've always been fascinated by the wealth of data available in the game. Recently, I embarked on a journey to create a custom dashboard.


## Technical Implementation

The dashboard is built using modern web technologies, focusing on:

* Real-time data processing
* Interactive visualizations
* Responsive design for all devices
* Secure authentication for personal stats (soon)
* Integration with Dota 2's OpenDota API

## Key Features

1. **Match History Analysis**
   * Detailed breakdown of recent matches
   * Win/loss trends
   * Performance metrics per hero (soon)

2. **Hero Statistics**
   * Win rates by hero
   * Average KDA ratios
   * Preferred roles and positions (soon)
